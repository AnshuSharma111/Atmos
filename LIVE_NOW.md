# 🎉 Your Atmos is Live!

## ✅ What's Working Now

**Backend Server (Render):** `https://atmos-7hli.onrender.com`
- ✅ Server is live on port 10000
- ✅ Viewer page works: https://atmos-7hli.onrender.com/viewer.html
- ⏳ `/api/debug` endpoint being deployed (pushed fix)

**Mobile App:** 
- ✅ Already configured with your Render URL in `App.tsx`

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Backend Redeploy (2 minutes)
I just added the `/api/debug` endpoint. Push it:

```powershell
git add server.js
git commit -m "Add /api/debug endpoint"
git push origin main
```

Render will auto-redeploy. Check logs at:
https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-YOUR-SERVICE-ID/logs

### 2. Test Backend Endpoints

After redeploy completes, test:

```powershell
# Test debug endpoint
curl https://atmos-7hli.onrender.com/api/debug

# Should return:
# {
#   "status": "online",
#   "server": "Atmos WebRTC Signaling Server",
#   "broadcasters": { "count": 0, "active": [] },
#   "serverTime": "2025-10-16T...",
#   "uptime": 123.45,
#   "environment": "production"
# }
```

### 3. Rebuild Mobile App

Your `App.tsx` already has the correct URL, so just rebuild:

```powershell
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

### 4. Test Full System

#### A. Start Streaming from Mobile
1. Open mobile app
2. Grant camera/mic permissions
3. Click "Start Streaming"
4. Should see "Connected" status
5. Should see "Streaming..." indicator

#### B. View on Website
1. Open: https://atmos-7hli.onrender.com/viewer.html
2. Click "Connect" button
3. Should see "Connected" status
4. Your stream should appear automatically
5. Try clicking "📷 Switch Camera" button

## 🌐 Your URLs

| Service | URL | Status |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **Viewer (Production)** | https://atmos-7hli.onrender.com/viewer.html | ✅ Live |
| **API Debug** | https://atmos-7hli.onrender.com/api/debug | ⏳ Deploying |

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Render Free Tier Behavior
- **Sleeps after 15 min idle** - First connection after sleep takes ~30 seconds
- **750 hours/month free** - More than enough for development
- **Keep awake**: Set up a cron job or uptime monitor (optional)

### Keep Server Awake (Optional)
If you want to prevent sleep:

**Option 1: UptimeRobot (Free)**
1. Sign up at https://uptimerobot.com
2. Add monitor for: https://atmos-7hli.onrender.com/api/debug
3. Set to ping every 5 minutes

**Option 2: GitHub Actions Cron Job**
I can set this up if you want - it pings your server every 10 minutes.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If mobile can't connect:
```powershell
# 1. Check server is awake
curl https://atmos-7hli.onrender.com/api/debug

# 2. Rebuild app
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd .. && npx react-native run-android

npx react-native log-android
```

### If viewer can't connect:
```powershell
# 1. Open browser console (F12)
# 2. Look for Socket.io connection errors
# 3. Check server logs on Render dashboard
```

### If stream is black:
- Camera permissions granted on mobile?
- Try camera switch button
- Check mobile app logs
